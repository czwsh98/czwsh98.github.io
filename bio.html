        <h1>Violence in the Age of Uncertainty</h1>
        <div id="poem">
        <p>There was me. <br>
        And we sat in the Korova Milk Bar,<br>
        trying to make up our rassoodocks,<br>
        what to do with the evening<br>
        The korova milk bar sold milk plus,<br>
        milk plus vellocet or syntheses or drencrom,<br>
        which is what we were drinking.<br>
        This would sharpen you up,<br>
        and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence.</p>
